Imperative - What you write is what happens. The programmer solves problems. 

Declarative - Construction of data 
             The programmer asks question. 
Structured - Control flow structures exist. 

O.O.P - Deconstruction of problems into constituent parts. Think in terms of things. 

Class Based - Make 
Prototype BAsed - Make objects		

Procedural - Buitim mechanisms for calling subroutines. 

Method- A procedure that modifies (global) implicit state. 

function - A procedure that cannot modify state. 

------------------------""--------------------------------------------

Event Driven: writing proedures to handle specific events. You dont write a main. Dont .... a lot of state. 
							   Event contains all info needed. 

Data Driven: Data decides the behavior of the application. Code does not need to change to affect behavior. 

Logical - Expert System "Deduce" rules and facts from rules and facts. 
	  Traditional Symbolic AI. 

Computation - The ability to solve an algorithm. 

Calculation - A single math equation. Basic calculator.

Abstractions - The ability to use a concept without understanding how it works. int vs 2's comp. 

Turing machines - The simplest mathematical construction of an arbitrary computation engine. 
		  Anything that we can compute is computable by a turing machine. 

Stack machine - 3 parts. 
	1/ Computation stack
	2/ Operators
	3/ Ram/Memory

Computation Stack where we store data for operators.
Push - Adds data to top.
Pop - Takes off top data. 

Theoretically Infinitely Large. 

Operators. Unary - one operand
	   Binary - two
	   Terary - three
Add- Binary Operation
   Pop two values 
   add them 
   Push the result 

Store - Pop some data and store into memory.

Retrieve - Retrieve data and push into stack. 

Stack machines are CPUs?

CPU --- ALU, bus connect to memory.  

Registers. 


------------------""-------------------------
Binding - When does the memory allocation for a declaration get determined?

Early Binding - All variable declared ... mem alloc's are determined during compile time. 

Late Binding - variable mem alloc are determined at run time. 

x = 3
x = "Hello"
x = User input()
